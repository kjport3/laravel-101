    <p>Recursion can be an intimidating topic to tackle, and it certainly does get complex and takes some thinking, but actually the basics of it are pretty simple and it's easy to get going with. The basic idea is, you take a problem, do it over and over again on a smaller or changing piece until you hit an endpoint. In our case, that means it's a function that calls itself itself.</p>
    <p>In order to get started with recursion we need to have an understanding of and visualize the call stack, and we need to understand the two essential components of a recursive function.</p>
