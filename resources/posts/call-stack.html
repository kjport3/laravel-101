    <p>The Call Stack is a data structure the JavaScript engine uses to manage Execution Contexts. Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a Function Execution Context for it, pushes it on top of the Call Stack, and starts executing the function. When the function completes, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call stack. In order for the function to "complete", we have to return a value using the return keyword. If a function calls another function, the JavaScript engine creates a new Function Execution Context for the function that is being called and pushes it on top of the call stack. We'll try to visualize what this looks like with some examples, after we talk about the two essential components of a recursive function.</p>
